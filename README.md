# ranking_info_retrieval
## Basic retrieval engine based on tf-idf

This project implements the following algorithms for document-query similarity computation and ranking:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Overlap: uses the overlap between non-capitalized words to rank the documents
\item Tf-idf: uses tf-idf as the weighting function for words and the weighted sum as the similarity function between the document and the query s(Q, D)
\item Rocchio: As in 2, this algorithm uses td-idf and the weighted sum formula for an initial ranking, but then optimizes the original query using Rocchioâ€™s algorithm
\end{enumerate}

report.pdf contains a description of the implemtation and the key results.
